# pgbackup_tool

This repository holds my final project that was developed at the end of an online class
with Linux Academy. The instructor, Keith Thompson, walked us through examing 
the problem, planning, structuring the project, test driven development, implementing
PostgresSQL, implementing local file storage and AWS S3 storage.

The final result was a database backup tool that could save backups locally or in S3. There 
were some small changes that had to be made; turns out programming languages do not always 
behave the same in a class room as the real world! :)

I am not the original creator of this tool and do not hold any rights to it. But it sure 
was fun learning how to build and debug along the way. 

Thank you Keith!
